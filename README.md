## üìå Project Description

MediScan AI is a deep learning-based medical tool for brain MRI image segmentation. It enables users to upload MRI scans, processes them using a pre-trained U-Net model, and returns:

- A segmented image (highlighting tumor area)
- A confidence score
- An auto-generated medical report (JSON + PDF)

**Key Features:**
- Upload single or multiple images
- View original and segmented images side by side
- Download segmented image
- Generate PDF and JSON reports including pathology, volume, and comparative analysis
- Lightweight and runs locally using Streamlit
